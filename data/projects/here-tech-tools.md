# My Journey with Metaphysic’s VFX Work on Robert Zemeckis' *Here*

As the Chief Technology and Product Officer of Metaphysic, I had the privilege of contributing to a project that pushed the boundaries of visual effects (VFX) in Robert Zemeckis' groundbreaking film, *Here*. While my role was just one part of an incredible collective effort, I’m immensely proud of what the team achieved together.

## 1. Introduction

### About *Here*
*Here*, directed by Robert Zemeckis, is a cinematic adaptation of Richard McGuire’s graphic novel. The story unfolds in a single location, weaving together lives and events across multiple timelines. Featuring performances by Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, the film required innovative visual storytelling to bring its unique narrative to life.

### The Role of Metaphysic
Metaphysic was the sole AI VFX provider for the film, tasked with creating hyper-realistic face replacements and de-aging effects. These effects were integral to portraying characters seamlessly across different eras, both during live on-set performances and in the final cut.

## 2. The Challenge of AI in Filmmaking

### Bringing Innovation On-Set
One of the most exciting aspects of this project was deploying Metaphysic Live technology on set. This enabled real-time face swaps and de-aging for the actors, giving the director and cast instant feedback. This real-time integration not only enhanced performances but also streamlined the creative process, allowing everyone to stay immersed in the story.

Additionally, our team developed tools to integrate AI into the production pipeline, combining entirely new AI-driven technologies with enhancements to existing workflows. This dual approach helped balance speed, efficiency, and quality in unprecedented ways.

### Collaborating with Creative Visionaries
Working alongside a visionary director like Robert Zemeckis was both humbling and inspiring. He described the necessity of these tools for *Here*:
> "With *Here*, the film simply wouldn’t work without our actors seamlessly transforming into younger versions of themselves. Metaphysic’s AI tools do exactly that, in ways that were previously impossible."

## 3. Technical Breakthroughs

### Real-Time, On-Set Magic
Using real-time AI transformations on set was a groundbreaking experience. The team had to deliver seamless face swaps at a speed comparable to traditional video feeds, all while accommodating multiple actors simultaneously. Watching actors adjust their performances based on these live effects was a testament to how far this technology has come—and how deeply it can impact storytelling.

### Balancing Scale and Precision
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring our AI pipelines could handle the scale of production. With hundreds of shots to process, automation was crucial to maintaining consistent, high-quality results. At the same time, our focus on refining models and techniques allowed us to push the limits of resolution, detail, and identity fidelity, achieving results beyond the current state of the art.

## 4. The Broader Impact

### Redefining What’s Possible in Entertainment
This project highlights how AI can enhance storytelling in ways previously unimaginable. Directors can now bring to life ideas that were once deemed impossible, while actors can explore a wider range of roles. The implications for the film industry—and the creative possibilities—are enormous.

## 5. Reflecting on the Experience

Contributing to *Here* was one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. Seeing the collaboration between some of the best creative minds in the industry and our talented tech and VFX team was inspiring. It was a rare opportunity to witness cutting-edge technology seamlessly integrated into the heart of storytelling.

While the credit for these achievements belongs to the entire Metaphysic team, I’m grateful to have been part of this journey. The lessons learned and the breakthroughs achieved will undoubtedly shape how I approach future projects—and  focus on the intersection of creativity and technology.
