# Building a rich link preview React Server Component

React Server Components are a game-changing feature that allows us to write components that run exclusively on the server. This can significantly improve performance and reduce the JavaScript bundle size sent to the client.

## The Challenge

When building modern web applications, we often need to display rich previews of links shared by users. These previews typically include:

- The page title
- A description
- An image
- The domain name

Traditionally, this would require making API calls from the client, handling loading states, and managing errors. With React Server Components, we can move this complexity to the server.

## The Solution

Here's how we built a server component that generates rich link previews:

```jsx
async function LinkPreview({ url }) {
  const preview = await fetchLinkPreview(url);
  
  return (
    <div className="link-preview">
      <img src={preview.image} alt={preview.title} />
      <h3>{preview.title}</h3>
      <p>{preview.description}</p>
      <span>{new URL(url).hostname}</span>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Better Performance**: No client-side API calls
2. **Smaller Bundle Size**: Preview logic runs on the server
3. **SEO Friendly**: Content is available in the initial HTML
4. **Better Error Handling**: Server-side errors don't affect the client
