## How I Use AI

Although I'm not oblivious of the problems arising from the intelectual property misappropriation by the AI model training corps, I've seen enough to believe there is no escape from a future where AI is omnipresent on everyone's life. 
		  
To that effect I'm committed to learn, understand, use and effectively leverage AI tooling to achieve my personal goals.

At this point in time this mostly means I'm reading about and experimenting with all kinds of AI tools on a daily basis.

## Tools I use daily

- [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) for all the development work I do. (on the €90/month plan)
    - Currently exploring their [online interface](https://claude.ai/code/).
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) to examine code changes and the autocomplete. (on the free plan)
- [Code Rabbit](https://coderabbit.ai/) for PR reviews. (on the $15/month plan)
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) for quick interactions on any subject. (on the free plan)
- In terms of Models when using API's I mostly use Sonet 4.5 or Haiku 4.5, Haiku when I need to have faster responses or cut on costs :)
