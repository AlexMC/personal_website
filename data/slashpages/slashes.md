# Slashpages

## What Are Slashpages?

Slashpages are a collection of common pages you can add to your personal website, usually with a URL like `/now` or `/uses`. They're part of the [indie web](https://indieweb.org/) movement and help make personal websites more discoverable and connected.

## My Slashpages

I've created several slashpages to share different aspects of my life and work. Check out the [sitemap](/sitemap) for the complete list.

## The Slashpages Movement

Started by Robb Knight at [slashpages.net](https://slashpages.net/), slashpages are becoming a common feature on personal websites. They provide standardized ways to share information like:

- What you're doing now
- Tools and apps you use
- How to contact you
- Content you recommend

## Make Your Own

If you have a personal website, consider adding some slashpages! They're a fun way to share more about yourself and connect with others in the indie web community.
