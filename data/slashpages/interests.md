# Interests

## What I'm Into

Topics and hobbies that capture my attention.

### Professional

I'm very fortunate in the sense that I don't need to focus on any topic just because of work, I can choose what I work on, and in that sense, there is no clear division between professional interests and hobbies, so you can see this Professional more as the ones I make revenue from.

- **AI** and specifically how to keep making the right choices, using AI only when it solves an existing problem.
- **Blockchain**, having a technology that allows the exchange of valuable assets between multiple parties without any need to trust a middleman, is very valuable, so the focus now is how can we bring this value to the end users.
- **Managing technical teams**, how to solve problems with technology by empowering individual contributors with the right set of tools.

### Hobbies

- 3D printing
- Gaming (retro games from the 8 and 16 bit era in particular)
- Lego
- Home networking / Self-hosting
- Home Automation (Home Assitant)

### Currently Exploring

- Combining some of my interests like AI and Home Automation.

### Want to Learn More About

- I'm a curious person; almost any topic has an angle that can pull me into a rabbit hole, so as long as I can dedicate a part of my time to keep learning and exploring these rabbit holes, I'm happy.
