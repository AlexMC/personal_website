# Blogroll

## Blogs (RSS feeds) I Follow

I mostly use RSS feeds to follow blogs and websites, so that's what I'm sharing here.
My RSS reader of choince both on Mac and iOS is [Reeder](https://reederapp.com/).

I also read my favorite newsletters trough my RSS feed using [Kill the Newsletter!](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/)

### Technology

- By far my main source of tech related news is [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).
I use the RSS feeds from [https://hnrss.github.io/](https://hnrss.github.io/) mainly:
    - [Active](https://hnrss.org/active)
    - [Front Page](https://hnrss.org/frontpage)
    - [Newest](https://hnrss.org/newest)
    - [Best](https://hnrss.org/best)
    - [Best Comments](https://hnrss.org/bestcomments)

- [Simon Willison’s Weblog](https://simonwillison.net/) a great source of news and insights on everything related with AI development.
- [The Rundown AI](https://www.therundown.ai/) My favorite daily newsletter on everything AI.
- [The Neuron](https://www.theneurondaily.com/) My second favorite daily newsletter on everything AI.
- [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/) Insights into the Apple ecosystem.

- [Spotify Engineering](https://engineering.atspotify.com/) Always fascinated with their technical posts.
- [One Useful Thing](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/) Prof. Ethan Mollik always writes very thoughtfull articles on the Implications of AI.
- [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/) Federico Viticci, John Voorhees, and the rest of the MacStories crew always have the best content on the Apple ecosystem.

### Gamming

I have always been fascinated by the gaming world. Nowadays, I don’t play much, but I still enjoy keeping up with what’s happening and often find inspiration in this world for my day-to-day work.

- [Wavelengths](https://wavelengths.online/) Brandon is a game aficionado and a great writer.
- [Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/) A generalist gaming site.
- [Metal Game Solid](https://metalgamesolid.com/) Metal Game Solid is a recent website that focuses on retro gaming news (a sub-genre I'm really fond of)

### Lego

I'm what nowadays is called an AFOL (Adult Fan of LEGO)...

- [The Brothers Brick](https://www.brothers-brick.com/about/) Probably the best blog covering the Adult LEGO fans world.
- [Brickset](https://brickset.com/) Primarly a database of LEGO sets they are also very fast at reporting on LEGo related news.

### Other 

- [News Minimalist](https://newsletter.newsminimalist.com/) An interesting experiment, they crawl 30K plus news articles per day and give them a significance score, surfacing daily the handful that are most significant.
- [Dense Discovery](https://www.densediscovery.com/) I don't know how to describe this newsletter but I know I love it. Maybe the best way is to quote Kai, the author:
> I now send a weekly newsletter that curates a mix of the practical and contemplative, highlighting paths toward a more considered existence online and in real life – one that resists the pull of the attention merchants.
