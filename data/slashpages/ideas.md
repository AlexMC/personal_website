# Ideas

## Projects I Want to Build

A collection of ideas I'm thinking about. Some of these might happen, many won't.

### Active Ideas

Projects I'm actively considering or working on:
(I'll be purposly vague, if you want to kknow more reach out)

- **Idea 1:** A way to manage and extend a LEGO collection;
- **Idea 2:** Preserve the retrogaming history for future generations to experince;
- **Idea 3:** Make the F1 Nerd GP viewing experience more engaging.

### Someday/Maybe

Ideas that sound cool but are on the back burner:

- Make people more aware of their health trough development a proper PHR.
- Use AI technology to help athletes improve faster even when they lack access to expensive training.

### Looking for Collaborators
